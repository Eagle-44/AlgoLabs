## TASK: Implement algorithm Bellman Ford 

### *Bellman Ford Algorithm* is an algorithm for `finding the shortest path in a weighted graph`. Finds the shortest paths from one vertex of the graph to all others. Unlike the Dijkstra algorithm, the Bellman-Ford algorithm `admits edges with negative weight`.
