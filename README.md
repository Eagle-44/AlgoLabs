## LAB SIX Task *"Electrics"*
Your company operates an electrical network in the village of Vilshanka. The condition of the tender was the involvement of local craftsmen, and you had to agree to it. These masters are unique, and as a result you `put/buried N piles/electric piles`, which are at a `distance w from each other`. The problem is that the exact height of each support is unknown - you only know that the `height of the support i is within [1, heights [i]]`, and you can connect the wire only to the top of the support (there is already installed the necessary equipment).

You order an electric wire to connect the piles from China, and it will take a long time to go/swim. You do not know exactly how much wire you need (it depends on the specific heights of the supports), so you want to order exactly as much as you need for the worst situation.
Constraints:
- w, heights [i] - integers in the range 1â€¦100;
- N < 50;
Of course, you should ignore the various physical limitations of wire sag or wire connection costs.
